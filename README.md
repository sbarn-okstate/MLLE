# TODO List

# TODO functional (High Priority)
- [ ] Animate step-by-step backpropagation at the beginning of training. After X seconds, the training should speed up.
- [ ] Add visual component to neurons that reflect biases
- [x] Figure out how to package the webapp - JM
- [x] Add a fullscreen button in the bottom right - JM
- [x] Make objects removeable by dragging to specific location - SB
- [x] Change startNode to 'Data Batcher'
- [x] Add specific drawers for datasets and activation functions - SB
- [x] Add tooltip buttons for each type of object and some buttons. (possibly add links to websites with more information)
- [ ] Update welcome screen to be useful. I.e. add information about the sandbox, what it's for, etc.
  
# TODO visual (Medium Priority)
- [x] Move button bar to the top of the screen
- [x] Resize objects so that spacing and linker lines look good.
- [x] Update activation function visuals to show what data it modifys (vertical highlight)
- [x] Update all objects so that they match the style of the neurons
- [x] Update snap point visuals so that they're linked to their object with a line.

# END OF PROJECT TODO
- [ ] Standardize inline comments
- [ ] Create dataset files and update dataset-defaults.js with their information
- [ ] Update header comments
- [ ] Remove unused variables, functions, and classes.
- [ ] Rename variables, functions, and classes to be appropriate.
- [ ] Cleanup and refactor code where appropriate to improve readability.

# Notes for presentation
 - Future work: allow user to select which input features to utilize
 - Talk about what components are dynamic vs state (e.g. dataset graphs)
