/* defaults.js
 *
 * AUTHOR(S): Samuel Barney
 *
 * PURPOSE: This file contains the default values for model layers
 * and model compilation.
 * 
 * NOTES: FIXME -> different datasets need different input shapes and loss functions.
 * Also we need a way to automatically make the last layer have 1 output unit and 
 * a sigmoid activation function (at least for classification problems).
 * Some of these changes should be made in the model.js file, but it may also be good to 
 * add a dataset_default.js file to handle some of these changes.
